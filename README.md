## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Smart Vehicle Tracking and Safety System** developed using ESP32. It tracks the vehicle’s location, monitors fuel level and speed, and provides real-time alerts for accidents and fuel theft. Alerts are sent to a **mobile app (via Blynk IoT)**, a **web dashboard**, and through **email with live Google Map links**.
